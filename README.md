I love listening to live, crazy, very loud rock music. A few years ago I got tickets for one of my favorite bands open up at a huge stadium-type venue in Detroit. I was pretty excited about it because I thought I'd get to rock out with thousands of people who shared my love for this band's music.

Does this sound like one of your events? Now that I've seen the pattern, I see this happen at all kinds of meetups. A few passionate people get excited about a big event, then are invariably dissapointed by the result.

We drove out and headed in, and the venue was practically empty. Confused, I saw they were already playing. But the place was empty and these guys were playing their set, but...to a large empty venue, the spirit just wasn't there. The show was mediocre at best.

I was crushed. Not only did the band I wanted to see play crappy, but in MY scene, the music I listen to, this band is a huge deal, and in trying to capture that cross-over mass crowd, the experience simply sputtered.

This kind of thing happens all the time for events and meetups too. You'll have a couple of passionate advocates who will do anything to spread the news about their passion. There seems to be an excited online following, so a metup is scheduled, and...it's the same small group of passionate advocates with too much pizza leftover. Again. Ready to spread the word to everyone, but everyone is not quite ready to commit yet.

I still go to rock shows of course, and several months ago I was reminded of what that scene was all about. A slightly less well-known band originally from my area came back to tour the state. The venue was a smaller club in my relatively small city, but the band played  to a packed house with hundreds of screaming fans who knew every word to every song. They blasted the doors off the place and the crowd amped the band to epic heights. It was the best show I've ever seen, and now I'm a fan for life. The music was good, but the passion of the group was what pushed me from being a casual fan to buying a t-shirt and forcing my friends to listen every chance I get. 

When you think about your meetup, which would you prefer? A) Big opportunity to catch a huge range of possible people that may not care or ever show up? Or B) a smaller focused event filled with passionate advocates that each brought a friend? For me, option B is a no-brainer. Most people don't join new groups or activities because the activity itself is inherently interesting. Most people join for social reasons when they have a passionate, motivated group of people to help them learn along the way. Combined with a passionate social base, a compelling idea, product, or service becomes irresistable.

Kickback has taken this core philosophy to incentivize and electrify that passionate base of supporters. The platform is simple: Supporters put up a stake in their interest for the event, and are rewarded for participating. When an attendee checks in for the event, the stake is refunded. That explicit financial carrot/stick gets people off their couch and into your event like they said they would when they registered.

There are a number of upsides to the "skin-in-the-game" approach to events. It legitimizes participant involvement and dedication in the event, like a gym membership. (If I pay for the gym membership, I better use it!). The network effects for these events also become incredible. Once you have many committed people who have the passion for a topic, then there are more opportunities for professional and creative connection, learning, and social dynamics from those with interestes in common. 

Not only does Kickback generate more passionate and involved attendees, but it makes event organizing more predictable, with better analytics for engagement. How many t-shirts do you need to print? If attendees put up money to say they'll be there, you can make a much more accurate prediction of what you'll need.

What Kickback provides is a needed model for events, and Kickback is a special kind of organization and platform. The platform is user-driven through a blockchain network. Simply put, Kickback does not manage the funds, the platform does. Kickback doesn't ensure the funds  are safe, the world's most secure blockchain network does. This protects event organizers, event participants, and opens event funding to more types of funds and events, while maintaining an intuitive and familiar experience for participants and event organizers.

The real barriers to people participating in events are their own priorities and schedules. Kickback is a simple idea that lets participants bring their passion to others, and know that they are not alone. Start now by building events that have skin-in-the-game, and revolutionize the way your community meets up.
